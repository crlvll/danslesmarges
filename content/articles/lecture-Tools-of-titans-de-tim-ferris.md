Tim Ferris a interviewé 200 personnalités intéressantes dans son podcast (The Tim Ferris Show). A chaque fois, des questions récurrentes concernant leur routine matinale, ou ce leur dernier achat le plus utile pour moins de 100$, par exemple.  
Il en résulte un gros pavé de 700 pages de "fiches" concentrant ce que ces gens utilisent et qui aurait contribué à leur succès.  
Quelques bonnes trouvailles, des idées à garder, et un peut-être quelques points communs à ressortir de toutes ces interviews.

## Mes notes :

 In _5 morning rituals that help me win the day_:  
 Meditate. At least 80% of all guests profiled in this book have a daily mindfulness practice of some type.  
 It's the more consistent pattern of them all.  
 It is a "meta-skill" that improves everything else. You're starting your day by practicing focus when it _doesn't_ matter (sitting on a couch for 10 minutes) so that you can focus better later when it _does_ matter.  

 In _My two favorite exercises from Chade-Meng Tan, in his own words_.   
 Just note gone. There is a simple practice that can greatly enhance your ability to notice the absence of pain, though it isn't only concerned with pain.  
 With "Just Note Gone" we train the mind to notice that something previously experienced is no more. For example, at the end of a breath, notice that the breath is over. Gone. As sound fades away, notice when it is over. Gone. At the end of a thought, notice that the thought is over. Gone. […]   
 This practice is, without a doubt, one of the most important meditation practices of all time. Meditation master Shinzen Young said that if he were allowed to teach only one focus technique and no other, it would be this one.  

 ### From _Derek Sivers_:
 If information was the answer, then we'd all be billionaires with perfect abs. TF: It's now what you know, it's what you do consistently.  
 How to thrive in an unknowable future ? Choose the plan with the more options. The best plan is the one that lets you change your plan.  
 "Busy"= out of control. Learn to say no. TF: Lack of time is lack of priority.  

### From _Matt Mullenberg_:
 Word that work. Pay increidible attention to word choice and ordering. Read _Word that work_ by Frank Lutz. It's brilliant.  

 ### From _Scott Adams_:
 Scott believes there are six elements of humor: naughty, clever, cute, bizarre, mean, and recognizable. You have to have at least two dimensions to succeed.  

 ### From _Chase Jarvis_:
 Creativity is an infinite resource. The more you spend, the more you have.  

 ### From _Kevin Kelly_:
 "Success" needs not to be complicated. Just start with making 1000 people extremely, extremely happy.  
 TF: By "success", he means "making a living", not "making a fortune". Creating 1000 true fans is also how you create massive hits, perennial mega-bestsellers, and worldwide fame. Everything big starts small and focused.  

### From _Peter Diamandis_:
 Some of Peter's 28 laws are  
 * Law 2 when given a choice, take both
 * Law 3 multiple projects lead to multiple succeses
 * Law 7 if you can't win, change the rules
 * Law 8 if you can't change the rules, ignore them
 * Law 11 "no" simply means begin again at one level higher
 * Law 13 when in doubt, THINK
 * Law 17 the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself
 * Law 19 you get what you incentivize
 * Law 22 the day before a breakthrough, it's a crazy idea
 * Law 26 if you can't measure it, you can't improve it

### From _Sam Harris_ on the power and liability of psychedelics:
 I don't think I ever would have discovered meditation without having taken, in particular, MDMA, but mushrooms and LSD also played a role for me in unveiling an inner landscape that was worth exploring…  
 He wrote a lenghty essay "Drugs and the Meaning of Life".  

### From _Kevin Kelly_:
 Productivity is for robots. What humans are going to be really good at is asking questions, being creative, and experiences.  
 The people-to-people, person-to-person trumps anything else.  
 TF: very similar to Derek Sivers' don't be a donkey rule. **In a world of distraction, single-tasking is a superpower.**  

### From _Alain de Botton_:
 Don't attribute to malice that which can be explained otherwise.  
 Don't expect others to understand you: to blame someone for not understanding you fully is deeply unfair because, first of all, we don't understant ourselves, and even if we do, we have such a hard time communicating ourselves to other people. Therefore, to be furious and enraged and bitter that people don't get all of who we are is really a cruel piece of immaturity.  

 Philosophers for a practical living: Epicurus, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Plato, Michel de Montaigne, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzche, and Bertrand Russel.  

### From _Amanda Palmer_:
Two words for conflict resolution are "Say less. Just say less."  
Book recommandation: _Dropping Ashes on the Buddha_ by zen master Seung Sahn.
