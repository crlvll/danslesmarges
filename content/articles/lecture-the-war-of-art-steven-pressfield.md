C'est la définition de ce qui m'empêche d'avancer dans mon travail créatif. Pressfield définit la _Résistance_, une entité qui s'insinue partout dans nos vies et nous empêche de faire ce que nous devons vraiment faire.  
Ce livre à vraiment résonné chez moi. À relire régulièrement.  
 
Peu de notes, car tout est bon.  


## Mes notes :

The awakening artist must be ruthless, not only with herself but with others. Once you make your break, you can't turn around for your buddy who catches his trouser leg on the barbed wire.  
The best and only thing that one artist can do for another is to serve as an example and an inspiration.  

We get ourselves in trouble because it's a cheap way to get attention.  

As artists and professionals it is our obligation to enact our own internal revolution, a private insurrection inside our own skulls. In this uprising we free ourselves from the tyranny of consumer culture.  

The artist is grounded in freedom. He is not afraid of it. He is lucky. He was born in the right place. He has a core of self-confidence, of hope for the future. He believes in progress and evolution. His faith is that humankind is advancing, however haltingly and imperfectly, toward a better world.  

Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do.  
The more scarde we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.
